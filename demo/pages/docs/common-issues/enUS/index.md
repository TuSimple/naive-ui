# Common Issues

## 1. The difference between onUpdate: xxx and @update: xxx

The v- prefix is ​​used as a visual cue to identify Vue-specific features in the template. When you are using Vue.js to add dynamic behavior to existing tags, the v- prefix is ​​very helpful. However, for some frequently used instructions, it will feel cumbersome to use. At the same time, when building a single page application (SPA-single page application) where Vue.js manages all templates, the v- prefix becomes less important. Therefore, Vue.js provides specific abbreviations for the two most commonly used commands, v-bind and v-on: "@" is the abbreviation of the command "v-on".
